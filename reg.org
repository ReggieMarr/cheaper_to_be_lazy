* Introduction
** A Bit About Us
- We work in the Software Engineering group at L3Harris Wescam
- Design gimbal-stabilized platforms that carry an array of sensors (cameras, lasers, etc) for air, land, and marine applications
- Most of our software targets multi-device embedded systems

** The Problem
- Our systems are complex, dynamic, and many of the design details/decisions exist only in tribal knowledge
- Our group has a grass-roots effort to preserve this knowledge in a variety of ways (formal software requirement documents, informal confluence pages, git commit messages, etc)
- Must maximize time spent creating content and minimize effort to format and maintain
- Eliminating frictions encourages our team to keep documentation up-to-date

** Our Solution
- Write content in a flexible mark-up/down language
- Use a dedicated export/formatting software to convert content into format of our choice (pdf, powerpoint, website, etc)

** Claims
- Decoupling back-end documentation source code from the front-end user experience can provide us a lot of flexibility/scalability that is hard/impossible to achieve with a WYSIWYG approach
- Storing data in open-source formats free us from proprietary tools and ensures future extensibility/stability

** Audience
- Anyone who writes docs (user guides, technical manuals, personal notes)
- Proficiency with a word processor and a linux or windows based environment
- A very small amount of command line

** Outline
- Part I: Learn how to write content in *markdown* for easy export into pdf, powerpoint, and static website formats
- Part II: Demo the benefits of extending markdown content with a small amount of mark-up syntax to allow for even more advanced/powerful workflows

** TODO Why use a text-based interface for document generation?
- Matrix comparing text vs WYSIWYG

* Part I
** What is Markdown?
- A simple mark-up language for creating formatted text in a plain-text editor
- Syntax designed to be more human-readable compared to other mark-up languages (xml, html, etc)

** Basic Markdown syntax
#+begin_src markdown
# A Pound Sets a Level 1 Heading
## Two Pounds Set a Level 2 Heading
### Subsequent Pounds Set More Deeply Nested Headings

*Sandwich a phrase in 1 asterisk to italicize*
**Sandwich a phrase in 2 asterisks to bold**

> Block quotes can be make by prepending with a right angle bracket

** Environment Setup
*** Supported platforms
- Linux
- Windows
- MacOS

Our tutorial has been tested on linux & windows, although everything should be portable to MacOS as well

| Pandoc          | Conversion between markup and various formats | Required           |
| Text Editor     | Sublime Text, vscode, notepad++, emacs, vim   | Required           |
| MikTex/TeX Live | Latex used as intermediate format for pdfs    | For PDFs           |

** Export to Powerpoint
1. Start a terminal or navigate to the =/part_1/1_powerpoint directory=
2. This directory contains the raw content =content.md= as well as a template powerpoint file, =template.pptx=, used to format the content for the correct letterhead. There is also a =.png= file that the markdown will include in the presentation.
3. Execute pandoc with the following command
   #+begin_src bash
   pandoc content.md -o content.pptx --reference-doc template.pptx
   #+end_src
   - Here we specify =content.md= as the source file for our content
   - The =-o= flag tells pandoc we'd like to convert this source file to another output file - in this case, a powerpoint file called =content.pptx=. We can give this file any name we like
   - The =--reference-doc= flag allows use to provide a powerpoint template used to style the document according to company requirements
4. =content.pptx= should now be created in the same directory as the rest of these files. Open the newly generated file in powerpoint to see the results!

** Export to PDF
1. Pandoc provides multiple ways to export your content to PDF. The default is using LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system, as an intermediate. Refer to the installation guide to get LaTex up and running on your system
2. Start a terminal or navigate to the =/part_1/2_pdf directory=
3. This directory contains the raw content =content.md= as well as the LaTex template, =template.latex=, used to format the content for the correct letterhead. There is also a =.png= file to included in the document and a =L3HarrisLogo.jpg= that will be included in the header of each page.
4. Execute pandoc with the following command
   #+begin_src bash
   pandoc content.md -o content.pdf --template template.latex
   #+end_src
   - Here we specify =content.md= as the source file for our content
   - The =-o= flag tells pandoc we'd like to convert this source file to another output file - in this case, a pdf file called =content.pdf=. We can give this file any name we like
   - The =--template= flag allows us to provide a latex template used to style the document according to company requirements. This incluedes a nice title page as well as a header and footer.
5. =content.pdf= should now be created in the same directory as the rest of these files. Open the newly generated file in powerpoint to see the results!

** Interim Q & A

* Glossary of terms
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language][Markup (Language)]] ::
    A family of languages used to facilate formatting for document generation.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor][Text Editor]] ::
  A type of program used to manipulate text.
- Git/Version Control ::
  Git is a version control application which provides analysis on differences within a project defined primarily as a collection of text files.
  Changes/Additions to the project can be isolated by unique units of work as "commits".
  These commits can be applied as patches or contained as branches.
- Modal Text Editing ::
  A form of text editing which seperates insertion and searching/reviewing/editing of text.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate Programming]]  ::
  A form of programming which relies on natural language punctutated by software specific syntax to describe how a program should operate.
* Part II :literate_programming:
An expansion of part I. When you have a markup language you get these extra things like:
*** Latex (why and how its used)) -> inserting symbols and formulas in word
*** Org syntax :org:
Org is a markup language primarily associated with Emacs.
It shares many features with markdown with a few bonuses such as;
- Execution of code blocks
- Tags
- Custom Properties
- Folding
- Links
  - Files
  - Websites
  - Git links

****** Properties.
****** Markup files can be masters overseeing sub files.
****** Code blocks (in org)
Code blocks are implemented in a number of markup languages, typically to provide context around software specific documentation.
While org provides this it also includes the ability to execute said code blocks which can be leveraged to generate content.

******* Temperature Data Example
The following example will utilize [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-python.html][Python code blocks]] to perform some simple analysis on some temperature data.

This bit of code doesn't do much but provides a means for retrieving the data in a format we can work with.

df = pd.read_csv("./en_climate_hourly_ON_6153193_02-2022_P1H.csv")
temp_series = df['Temp (°C)'].dropna()
