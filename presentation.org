* Introduction
** A Bit About Us
- We work in the Software Engineering group at L3Harris Wescam
- Design gimbal-stabilized platforms that carry an array of sensors (cameras, lasers, etc) for air, land, and marine applications
- Most of our software targets multi-device embedded systems

** The Problem
- Our systems are complex, dynamic, and many of the design details/decisions exist only in tribal knowledge
- Our group has a grass-roots effort to preserve this knowledge in a variety of ways (formal software requirement documents, informal confluence pages, git commit messages, etc)
- Must maximize time spent creating content and minimize effort to format and maintain
- Eliminating frictions encourages our team to keep documentation up-to-date

** Our Solution
- Write content in a flexible mark-up/down language
- Use a dedicated export/formatting software to convert content into format of our choice (pdf, powerpoint, website, etc)

** Claims
- Decoupling back-end documentation source code from the front-end user experience can provide us a lot of flexibility/scalability that is hard/impossible to achieve with a WYSIWYG approach
- Storing data in open-source formats free us from proprietary tools and ensures future extensibility/stability

** Audience
- Anyone who writes docs (user guides, technical manuals, personal notes)
- Proficiency with a word processor and a linux or windows based environment
- A very small amount of command line

** Outline
- Part I: Learn how to write content in *markdown* for easy export into pdf, powerpoint, and static website formats
- Part II: Demo the benefits of extending markdown content with a small amount of mark-up syntax to allow for even more advanced/powerful workflows

** TODO Why use a text-based interface for document generation?
- Matrix comparing text vs WYSIWYG

* Part I
** What is Markdown?
- A simple mark-up language for creating formatted text in a plain-text editor
- Syntax designed to be more human-readable compared to other mark-up languages (xml, html, etc)

** Basic Markdown syntax
#+begin_src markdown
# A Pound Sets a Level 1 Heading
## Two Pounds Set a Level 2 Heading
### Subsequent Pounds Set More Deeply Nested Headings

*Sandwich a phrase in 1 asterisk to italicize*
**Sandwich a phrase in 2 asterisks to bold**

** Export to Powerpoint
1. Start a terminal or navigate to the =/part_1/1_powerpoint directory=
2. This directory contains the raw content =content.md= as well as a template powerpoint file, =template.pptx=, used to format the content for the correct letterhead. There is also a =.png= file that the markdown will include in the presentation.
3. Execute pandoc with the following command
   #+begin_src bash
   pandoc content.md -o content.pptx --reference-doc template.pptx
   #+end_src
   - Here we specify =content.md= as the source file for our content
   - The =-o= flag tells pandoc we'd like to convert this source file to another output file - in this case, a powerpoint file called =content.pptx=. We can give this file any name we like
   - The =--reference-doc= flag allows use to provide a powerpoint template used to style the document according to company requirements
4. =content.pptx= should now be created in the same directory as the rest of these files. Open the newly generated file in powerpoint to see the results!

** Export to PDF
1. Pandoc provides multiple ways to export your content to PDF. The default is using LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system, as an intermediate. Refer to the installation guide to get LaTex up and running on your system
2. Start a terminal or navigate to the =/part_1/2_pdf directory=
3. This directory contains the raw content =content.md= as well as the LaTex template, =template.latex=, used to format the content for the correct letterhead. There is also a =.png= file to included in the document and a =L3HarrisLogo.jpg= that will be included in the header of each page.
4. Execute pandoc with the following command
   #+begin_src bash
   pandoc content.md -o content.pdf --template template.latex
   #+end_src
   - Here we specify =content.md= as the source file for our content
   - The =-o= flag tells pandoc we'd like to convert this source file to another output file - in this case, a pdf file called =content.pdf=. We can give this file any name we like
   - The =--template= flag allows us to provide a latex template used to style the document according to company requirements. This incluedes a nice title page as well as a header and footer.
5. =content.pdf= should now be created in the same directory as the rest of these files. Open the newly generated file in powerpoint to see the results!

****** Code blocks (in org)
Code blocks are implemented in a number of markup languages, typically to provide context around software specific documentation.
While org provides this it also includes the ability to execute said code blocks which can be leveraged to generate content.

******* Temperature Data Example
The following example will utilize [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-python.html][Python code blocks]] to perform some simple analysis on some temperature data.

******** Retrieving data with Python & Pandas
The following is some example code which retrieves data from some csv into a pandas dataframe.

The syntax of this code block might appear more complex than a markdown but its accomplishing a similar goal; Upon export recognize this content as code and apply language specific syntax highlighting.

#+name: read_csv_header
#+begin_src python :exports code
# we'll import pandas to do some simple data manipulation
import pandas as pd

# read the previously downloaded data and store as a data series
datafilename = "en_climate_hourly_ON_6153193_02-2022_P1H"
df = pd.read_csv(f"./{datafilename}.csv")
temp_series = df['Temp (°C)']
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: read_csv_header
: None

Now that we have some code block describing how we retrieved some data we might also want to display a summary of said data.
In this case we'll use a code block in a way distinct from how one might typically use code blocks in markdown or other markup languages; /as executables/.

#+name: print_data_frame
#+begin_src python :noweb yes :exports result :results output
<<read_csv_header>>

print(df)
#+end_src

Note the syntax =:noweb yes= and =<<read_csv_header>>=. This uses [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html][noweb]] which allows referencing of previous code blocks from within code blocks.

The following content is generated by a code block which is part of the document but which itself not exported into the final document. This is indicated by the syntax =:exports results=.

Finally the =:results output= syntax indicates that upon execution of this code block we want to render that which is piped to =stdout=.

#+RESULTS: print_data_frame
#+begin_example
     Longitude (x)  Latitude (y)  ... Wind Chill Flag        Weather
0           -79.94         43.17  ...             NaN            NaN
1           -79.94         43.17  ...             NaN          Clear
2           -79.94         43.17  ...             NaN            NaN

668         -79.94         43.17  ...             NaN            NaN
669         -79.94         43.17  ...             NaN            NaN
670         -79.94         43.17  ...             NaN            NaN
671         -79.94         43.17  ...             NaN            NaN

******** Pipe parsed data into raw org
Sometimes it can be useful to generate content with formatting which is conditional on the content itself.
To accomplish this we use the syntax =:results output raw= to indicate that we would like to render the output of some code block as raw org.

#+name: read_csv
#+begin_src python :noweb strip-export :export both :results output raw
<<read_csv_header>>

print(f"- {datafilename} Custom Summary ::")
print("\t#+TBLNAME: data_table")
print("\t| Location | Temp (Min °C) | Temp (Max °C) | Temp (Mean °C) |")
print("\t|-+-+-|")
print(f"\t | Hamilton | {temp_series.min()} | {temp_series.max()} | {temp_series.mean()}|")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: read_csv
- ./en_climate_hourly_ON_6153193_02-2022_P1H.csv Custom Summary ::
	#+TBLNAME: data_table
	| Location | Temp (Min °C) | Temp (Max °C) |     Temp (Mean °C) |
	|----------+---------------+---------------+--------------------|
	| Hamilton |         -17.6 |           8.5 | -4.354656862745095 |

Going further still we can reference tables in our code blocks when some further analysis is needed.
Note the code block syntax =:var tbl=data_table= references the =TBLNAME=.
#+name: read_table
#+begin_src python :export both :results output :var tbl=data_table
print(f"Middle val is {(tbl[0][1] + tbl[0][2])/2}")
#+end_src

Since code blocks support a variety of languages one usecase for this might be a code block which generates some test data which is referenced later by a code block which itself is testing some code (possibly also written in a code block).

******** Generate interactive and non-interactive plots with Plotly
In some cases it may be useful to provide a visual representation of some processed data set.
By using code blocks we can leverage [[https://plotly.com/][plotly]] to generate a variety of static and interactive plots of some dataset.

This code block takes our dataset and produces both an interactive and static plot. We can then conditionally utlize either depending on how we are presenting/exporting our document.
#+name: plot_temperature_data
#+begin_src python :noweb strip-export :results output raw :exports both :tangle plot_temp.py
<<read_csv_header>>

import plotly
import plotly.express as px

image_filename = "temp_series"

fig = px.line(df, x=list(df.index), y=temp_series)
fig.update_layout(xaxis_title="Hamilton Hourly Temp", yaxis_title="Degrees C")
# fig.write_image(f"{image_filename}.png")
plotly.offline.plot( fig, filename=f"{image_filename}.html", image_filename=image_filename,
                     image='png', auto_open=False)

print(f"[[file:{image_filename}]]")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: plot_temperature_data
[[file:temp_series]]

#+name: test
#+begin_src python :results output
import os
print(os.path)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: test
